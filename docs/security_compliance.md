## Security, Privacy, and Compliance (Minors)

### Principles
- Parental control first, data minimization, regional compliance modes

### Identity & Consent
- Parent-centric accounts; explicit consent for child profiles; revocation flows
- Age verification vendor integration; regional toggles (COPPA, GDPR-K, etc.)

### Data Protection
- Encrypt PII at rest; field-level encryption for child data
- Access control with least privilege; audited access paths
- Data residency by region; deletion/erasure workflows

### Content Safety
- Multi-model moderation (text/image/audio) + human review + appeals
- Youth mode defaults; tool permission whitelists

### Tool Sandbox & Permissions
- Scoped APIs, token time-bounding, isolated execution (WASM/containers)
- Event logging, anomaly detection, emergency kill-switch

### Compliance Operations
- Transparency reports; incident response runbooks; periodic external audits
