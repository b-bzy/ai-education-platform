# AI Kids Education Platform — Implementation Design

This repository contains the implementation design for an AI enlightenment platform for children, serving three roles:
- Teachers/Creators
- Parents (families)
- AI Education Tool Developers

Use the docs directory to navigate architecture, website structure, APIs, data model, security/compliance, and MVP roadmap.

## Directory
- docs/architecture/stack.md — Architecture and tech stack (fully centralized)
- docs/web/sitemap.md — Role-based information architecture and routes
- docs/web/components.md — UI components, key pages, and states
- docs/backend/api.md — API contract (auth, courses, orders, progress, community)
- docs/data/model.md — Data model for storage
- docs/security_compliance.md — Safety, privacy, and compliance for minors
- docs/mvp/plan.md — MVP scope, milestones, and metrics

## Next Steps
- Review docs and confirm priorities
- Choose MVP depth for web and backend
- Start scaffolding app and services from these specs
